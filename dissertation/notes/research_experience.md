# Research Experience: TSP Reinforcement Learning Ablation Study

## Overview
This research project conducted a comprehensive ablation study on the state representation components in a reinforcement learning approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The study employed a systematic experimental framework to analyze how different state components contribute to model performance.

## Research Objectives
1. **State Component Analysis**: Investigate the individual contribution of each state representation component in TSP RL models
2. **Ablation Methodology**: Develop a robust framework for conducting multi-stage ablation experiments
3. **Generalization Assessment**: Evaluate model performance across different training paradigms (per-instance vs cross-instance)

## Experimental Framework

### State Representation Components
The TSP RL model utilized four core state components:
- **Current City One-hot**: Binary encoding of the current city position
- **Visited Mask**: Binary mask indicating previously visited cities
- **Order Embedding**: Sequential information about visit order
- **Distances from Current**: Distance matrix from current position to all other cities

### Multi-Stage Data Processing Pipeline
The analysis employed a sophisticated three-stage data processing approach:

#### Stage 0: Run-level Aggregation
- Filtered data to completed episodes (done=1)
- Separated training and testing phases
- Aggregated performance metrics at the run level
- Computed optimality gap: `(current_distance - optimal_distance) / optimal_distance * 100`

#### Stage 1: Instance-level Aggregation
- Eliminated run_id dimension through statistical aggregation
- Calculated max, min, mean, and standard deviation across runs
- Preserved instance-level granularity for detailed analysis

#### Stage 2: Configuration-level Aggregation  
- Further aggregated across instance_id dimension
- Generated final performance metrics for each algorithm-configuration combination
- Enabled comparative analysis across different experimental conditions

### Ablation Analysis Methodology

#### Component Contribution Analysis
- **Marginal Contribution**: Measured performance impact when each component is individually removed
- **Interaction Effects**: Analyzed synergistic effects between component pairs using the formula: `Interaction = Combined_Effect - (Effect_A + Effect_B)`
- **Importance Ranking**: Ranked components by absolute marginal contribution magnitude

#### Pathway Analysis
- **Optimal Degradation Path**: Identified the sequence of component removals with minimal performance loss
- **Worst-case Scenario**: Analyzed maximum performance degradation patterns
- **Degradation Metrics**: Calculated total degradation, step-wise degradation rates, and pathway efficiency

## Key Research Findings

### Component Importance Hierarchy
The ablation study revealed distinct importance patterns among state components:
1. Components showed varying degrees of criticality based on the training paradigm
2. Certain components exhibited redundancy, suggesting potential model optimization opportunities
3. Interaction effects between components were significant, indicating non-additive contributions

### Performance Degradation Patterns
- **Gradual Degradation**: Most ablation paths showed gradual performance decline
- **Critical Components**: Some components caused substantial performance drops when removed
- **Pathway Efficiency**: Different removal sequences yielded varying degradation rates

### Training Paradigm Impact
The study compared two training approaches:
- **Per-instance Training**: Model trained and tested on specific TSP instances
- **Cross-instance Training**: Model trained on diverse instances for generalization
